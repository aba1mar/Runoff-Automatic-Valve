# Runoff-Automatic-Valve
Project was developed for the conditions of sixteen individual pens located in the “700 alley” feedlot in the Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center, Ithaca, NE. Each pen measures 8.53 m wide by 24.38 m long for an area of 208 m2.  Individual pens are separated by 0.46 m tall concrete stem walls in their south, east, and west sides, and by steel posts in the end view at their north side. The predominant soils are Yutan Silty Clay Loam (66% of the area) and tomek silt loam on the six other pens (34% of the feedlot), with two to six percent south-to-north slopes (NRCS, 2021).

An Arduino-based automation system for tank discharge and water level logging was designed. An Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board was the microcontroller used to drive the different components of the systems while allowing WiFi connectivity. The board was able to send real-time readings to and being controlled from Arduino IoT Cloud.

Objective:

•	Design an automazed prototype system for pen-level collection and characterization of feedlot runoff adapted to the conditions of ENREC feedlot pens.
